# Haskell PLP
This repository is for learning Haskell in CS 330 at Simmons University.

Written by Rachel Peffley.
## History
Haskell was written by committee from 1987-1990 to be a purely functional language.

## Getting Started
### Installation
#### Hello World
#### Comments
Comments are enclosed in double hyphens "--lcv--" or curly braces and a single hyphen "{-lcv-}".

## Names, Types, and Binding
### Naming
Haskell is case sensitive. Function names and variables must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores and cannot begin with a number. Data types must start with a capital letter. Camel case is strongly preferred over snake case.
