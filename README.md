# Haskell PLP
This repository is for learning Haskell in CS 330 at Simmons University.

Written by Rachel Peffley.
## History
Haskell was written by committee from 1987-1990 to be a purely functional language. At the time there were a number of functional languages, each with little widespread use. Haskell was developed by academics and proponents of functional programming to be a single, widely used functional language.

## Getting Started
### Installation
To install Haskell run the following commands as a non-administrative user.

**Linux and macOS**

In the terminal type ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh```

**Windows**

In the PowerShell type ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; try { & ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/sh/bootstrap-haskell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing))) -Interactive -DisableCurl } catch { Write-Error $_ }```

These commands will install the Haskell Toolchain which includes the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), the haskell-language-server (HLS), cabal-install, and stack.

### Hello World
The following code is the simplest way to write a "Hello World" program.

```
module HelloWorld where

sayHello::String
sayHello = "Hello World"
```

This code can be run two different ways. The first is to open a command prompt window and navigate to the directory containing the file. Run the command `ghci`. Once the interpreter is running, type `:l HelloWorld` at the prompt. The HelloWorld module will be loaded. From there, type `sayHello` and hit enter. The function will return the string "Hello World".

The second way to run this code is to open the folder that contains the file in VS Code. Inside the terminal type `runghc ./HelloWorld` and hit enter. The program will compile and print "Hello World" to the screen.
#### Comments
Single line comments are denoted by double hyphens. Ex. `--lcv`

Multi-line comments are enclosed in curly braces and two hyphens. Ex. `{-lcv-}`

## Names, Types, and Binding
### Naming
Haskell is case sensitive. Function names and variables may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores and cannot begin with a number or capital letter. Data types must start with a capital letter. Camel case is strongly preferred over snake case.

The following are keywords and cannot be used as variable or function names.
```
case, class, data, deriving, do,
else, if, import, in, infix, infixl,
infixr, instance, let, of, module,
newtype, then, type, where
```
### Types
All variable types are immutable.

The command `:t` can be used in the interpreter to find the type of any expression.
```
ghci> :t 'A'
'A' :: Char
```

**The most common data types in Haskell are Int, Double, Bool, Char, and String.**
```
x :: Int
x = 4

y :: Double
y = 8.9999
```
The syntax for boolean values is `True` and `False`.
```
bool1 :: Bool
bool1 = True
```
Chars store a single Unicode character. Chars can be written as the character in single quotes `'!'`, the character's decimal code point `'\033'`, or the hexadecimal code point `'\x0021'`.
```
char1 :: Char
char1 = 'A'
```
Strings are stored as lists of Chars.
```
string1 :: String
string1 = "Hello"
```
**Other data types include Integer, Ratio Integer, and Float.**
```
z :: Integer
z = 54000000
```
Int only supports integers between Â±536870911, while Integer is unbounded.
```
r :: Ratio Integer
r = 9%4
```
Ratio Integers can be imported from Data.Ratio and support exact rational numbers.
```
f :: Float
f = 9.0
```
**Any of these data types can be stored in a list.**
```
--create list of integers
numbers :: [Int]
numbers = [1,2,8,3]

--create list of strings
strings :: [String]
strings = ["Hello", "Hi", "Goodbye"]
```
#### Type Classes
Num and Fractional are type classes in Haskell that include several types.
#### Type System
**Haskell is statically typed**

The code below will not compile and will return the error "Multiple declarations of 't'.
```
x::Int
x = 10

x::String
x = "Hello"
```
**Haskell is strongly typed**

None of the examples below will compile.
```
addStrings :: String -> String -> String
addStrings s1 s2 = s1 + s2

addStringNum :: String -> Int -> String
addStringNum s1 n1 = s1 + n1

addIntDouble :: Int -> Double -> Double
addIntDouble integer double = integer + double
```
**Haskell is explictly typed by convention**

The type system of Haskell can infer types, but it is considered good practice to include explicit type signatures. Either version of the function below will run, but the second is the community standard.
```
getSum num1 num2 = num1 + num2

getSum :: Num a => a -> a -> a
getSum num1 num2 = num1 + num2
```
### Operators
### Binding

## Functions
The conventional syntax for functions is to write their type signature and then the function definition. The double colon in the type signature should be read as "has type." The final data type in the type signature (the second Float in the example below) is the data type that the function returns. The preceding types (Int and Float) specify the type of the function parameters. The function definition should have the format of nameOfFunction parameter1 parameter2 ... parameterN = ...
```
price :: Int -> Float -> Float
price quantity cost  = fromIntegral quantity * cost
```
Haskell supports recursive functions.
```
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial c = c*factorial(c-1)
```
